## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Using `small viewport width` would prevent layout changes caused by mobile browser address bars.

```css
body {
  min-height: 100svh;
}
```

### Continued development

- [ ] figuring out the balance between using browser default stylesheet and css reset
