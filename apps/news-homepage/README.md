## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla CSS Nesting
- TypeScript
  - for mobile hamburger menu

### What I learned

- Using Vanilla CSS Nesting was a wonderful experience, and felt no different than using a preprocessor like Sass.
- Learned that the `object-fit` property for the `<picture>` element should be applied to the child `<img>` element.
- You need to wait for the [`DOMContentLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event) event to manipulate DOM when the JS script tag is inside `<head>`.

### Continued development

- Should consider adding animation to hamburger menu and hover styles for user engagement.
- Grasp a further understanding of Vanilla JS(TS) DOM manipulation.
